===============

## This is an Flex library for Google Calendar Data API.

So far it supports:

* retrieving calendars 
* adding a new calendar 
* updating a calendar
* deleting a calendar
* retrieving events from a calendar
* adding an event
* updating an event
* set recurrence options when adding or updating events (this is not full featured yet just look at the Recurrence class to view options).
* delete an event

For convenience and testing it was setup as an air project. In the main application there are some buttons and lists that handle all these calls mostly with hardcoded values.
There is some work left to be done (part of the api is not yet supported) but it might be useful as it is for some projects that's why we've decided to release it now.
