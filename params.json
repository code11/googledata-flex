In the main application there are some buttons and lists that handle all these calls mostly with hardcoded values.\r\n\r\nThere is some work left to be done (part of the api is not yet supported) but it might be useful as it is for some projects that's why we've decided to release it now.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
